## 🧠 Linux Philosophy

Linux follows a minimalist, modular approach with 5 core principles:

| Principle                                 | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Everything is a file**                 | Most configuration is stored in text files.                                |
| **Small, single-purpose programs**       | Each tool does one thing well and can be reused.                           |
| **Chainability of programs**             | Tools can be combined to handle complex tasks.                             |
| **Avoid captive UIs**                    | Prefer command-line interface (shell) for full control.                    |
| **Config as text files**                 | e.g., /etc/passwd stores user data in plain text format.                |

## 🧩 Linux Components

| Component         | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bootloader**     | Starts the OS boot process (e.g. GRUB in Parrot OS).                        |
| **OS Kernel**      | Core part of Linux, managing I/O and hardware at low level.                 |
| **Daemons**        | Background services (e.g. scheduling, printing) that run after boot/login.  |
| **OS Shell**       | CLI interface for interacting with the OS (e.g. Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.).     |
| **Graphics Server**| Provides GUI capabilities via X-server.                                    |

# 📂 Linux File System Hierarchy

Linux uses a **tree-like hierarchical structure**, standardized by the **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**. Everything starts from the root directory `/`, and all other directories are mounted underneath it.

---

## 🗂️ Top-Level Directories

| Path       | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `/`        | The **root directory**. Contains the essential files needed to boot the OS before other filesystems are mounted. All other filesystems are mounted here as subdirectories. |
| `/bin`     | Contains **essential user command binaries** (e.g. `ls`, `cp`, `mv`). |
| `/boot`    | Contains the **bootloader**, **kernel image**, and other files required to boot Linux. |
| `/dev`     | Contains **device files** that represent hardware components. |
| `/etc`     | Contains **system-wide configuration files** for the OS and installed applications. |
| `/home`    | Contains **user home directories** (e.g. `/home/alex`). |
| `/lib`     | Contains **shared libraries** needed by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`. |
| `/media`   | Mount point for **removable media** (USB, CD-ROMs, etc.). |
| `/mnt`     | Temporary mount point for manually mounted filesystems. |
| `/opt`     | Optional software and **third-party applications** are installed here. |
| `/root`    | The **home directory of the root user**. |
| `/sbin`    | Contains **system administration binaries**, used by root. |
| `/tmp`     | Temporary files used by the OS and applications; usually cleared on reboot. |
| `/usr`     | Secondary hierarchy for **user utilities**, applications, libraries, and documentation. |
| `/var`     | Contains **variable data** such as logs, spool files, mail, and cache. |

---

## ⚙️ Why Use the Terminal?

- **Faster & more efficient** than GUI.
- No need for editors like `vim` or `nano` for basic file edits.
- Ability to:
  - Access files quickly with simple commands
  - Use **regex** for targeted edits
  - Chain multiple commands for batch file handling
  - Redirect output (`>` `>>`) and automate workflows

---

## 🔥 Advantages of CLI File Management

- Interactive and **scriptable**
- Can process **many files at once**
- Saves time vs. doing edits manually in GUI
- Ideal for automation, scripting, and system maintenance

---

# 🛠️ Create, Move, and Copy - HTB Notes

## 🚀 Starting Point

- Before running file operations, connect to the target via **SSH**.

---

## 📄 Create a File

- **`touch <filename>`** → Creates an empty file
  
## 📁 Create a Directory

- **`mkdir <dirname>`** → Creates a single directory

- **`mkdir -p <path>`** → Creates nested directories, including parents if needed

- **`-p`** is useful when building directory structures in one command.

---

# 🛠️ Create, Move, and Copy (Part 2) - HTB Notes

## 🌲 View Directory Structure

- Use `tree` to visualize folder hierarchy:

Example output:
.
├── info.txt
└── Storage
    └── local
        └── user
            └── documents

4 directories, 1 file

## 📄 Create Files in Nested Directories

Use relative path with **` ./ `**to start from the current directory:
touch ./Storage/local/user/userinfo.txt
Resulting structure:

.
├── info.txt
└── Storage
    └── local
        └── user
            ├── documents
            └── userinfo.txt

4 directories, 2 files
✏️ Rename or Move Files with mv

Syntax:
- **` mv <source> <destination> `**

Rename file:

**` mv info.txt information.txt `**

---

# ✏️ Editing Files

## 🔍 Overview
- After creating files and directories, we need to **edit** them.
- Common editors in Linux: **Vi**, **Vim**, **Nano**.
- We'll start with **Nano** (simple and beginner-friendly), then **Vim** (powerful and modal).

## 🖊️ Using Nano

- Open (or create) a file with **nano**:
  ```bash
  nano notes.txt

- This opens the Nano editor and lets you edit text immediately.

### ✅ Nano Basics

- Write text directly in the editor.
- Important shortcuts (the ^ symbol means CTRL):
Shortcut	Action
- **`CTRL + W`**	Search text
- **`CTRL + O`**	Save file
- **`CTRL + X`**	Exit Nano
- **`CTRL + G`**	Help

## 🔐 Important Files for Pentesters

- **` /etc/passwd `** → Holds user info (username, UID, GID, home dir).
Historically stored password hashes (now in /etc/shadow).
Misconfigured permissions = potential privilege escalation.

## ⚡ Vim - Vi Improved

- Vim is an open-source, modal text editor.
- Modal concept → Different modes for different actions.
  
### ✅ Vim Modes

Mode	Description: 

- Normal	Default mode; commands (move, delete, copy, etc.)
- Insert	Insert text into buffer
- Visual	Select text visually for operations
Command	Enter commands like :q, :w, :sort, etc.
Replace	Overwrite existing text

## 🎓 VimTutor

- Practice Vim with built-in tutorial:
- Approx time: 25-30 mins.
- Covers essential commands for beginners.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways
- Nano = Simple, beginner-friendly editor.
- Vim = Powerful, modal, ideal for advanced editing.
- Important files (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow) matter for security.
- Always check file permissions for privilege escalation opportunities.

- When accessing a Linux system, it's essential to **quickly find files and directories**.
- Common scenarios:
  - Locate **configuration files**
  - Find **scripts created by admins or users**
  - Check system files for **security issues**
- No need to manually browse every folder—Linux provides tools for this.

## 📌 `which` Command

- **Purpose:** Displays the path of an executable that would run if the command is executed.
- **Usage:** Helps verify if programs like `curl`, `netcat`, `wget`, `python`, `gcc` are available.
  
### ✅ Syntax:
```bash
which <program>
```
---

## **Find Command in Linux**

- The `find` command is a powerful utility for **searching files and directories** in Linux. It supports advanced filtering options to locate files based on multiple criteria.


### **Purpose**
- Locate **files and directories** within a specified location.
- Apply **filters** such as:
  - **File size**
  - **Modification date**
  - **Type** (file or directory)


### **Syntax**
```bash
find <location> <options>
```

- **`<location>`** : Directory path to start the search (e.g., /home, . for current directory).
- **`<options>`**: Flags and conditions to filter results.

- Key Features: 
  - Supports searching by:
    - Name
    - Type (file, directory, symbolic link)
    - Permissions
    - Date modified
- Can execute actions on found files (e.g., delete, move, print).

---

## **Find Command Options Explained**

When using the `find` command, several options can refine the search and define what actions to perform. Below is an explanation of the common options used:

---

### **Options and Their Descriptions**

- **`-type f`**  
  Defines the type of the searched object. Here, `f` stands for **file**.

- **`-name *.conf`**  
  Searches for files matching a specific name pattern. The asterisk (`*`) acts as a wildcard, meaning **all files with the `.conf` extension**.

- **`-user root`**  
  Filters files that are owned by the **root user**.

- **`-size +20k`**  
  Finds files **larger than 20 KiB**. The `+` sign indicates "greater than."

- **`-newermt 2020-03-03`**  
  Lists files **modified after** the specified date (`2020-03-03`).

- **`-exec ls -al {} \;`**  
  Executes a command on each result.  
  - `{}` acts as a placeholder for the found file.  
  - `\;` ends the `-exec` command. The backslash escapes the semicolon so it isn’t interpreted by the shell.

- **`2>/dev/null`**  
  Redirects **STDERR (error messages)** to the null device (`/dev/null`) to hide errors.  
  *Note:* This is **not an option of `find`** but a shell redirection.

---

### **Example**
```bash
find /etc -type f -name "*.conf" -user root -size +20k -newermt 2020-03-03 -exec ls -al {} \; 2>/dev/null
```

### **Command Breakdown**

This command performs the following:

- **Searches under** `/etc`
- **For files** (`-type f`)
- **Named** `*.conf`
- **Owned by** `root`
- **Larger than** `20 KiB`
- **Modified after** `2020-03-03`
- **Executes** `ls -al` on each result
- **Hides any errors** by redirecting them to `/dev/null`

---

## **Locate Command in Linux**

The `locate` command provides a **faster way to search for files and directories** compared to `find`. Unlike `find`, which scans the filesystem in real-time, `locate` searches a **local database** containing file and folder paths.

### **Key Characteristics**
- **Works with a pre-built database** instead of real-time scanning.
- **Faster than `find`** because it doesn’t traverse the filesystem during the search.
- Requires **database updates** to reflect recent changes.

### **Update the Database**
To ensure the `locate` database is up-to-date:
```bash
sudo updatedb
```

### **Limitations**
- Fewer filtering options than `find` (e.g., cannot filter by size, date, or ownership).
- Best used for quick searches by name, not for detailed filtering.

### **When to Use**
- Use **`locate`** for speed when you just need to find files by name.
- Use **`find`** when advanced filtering is required (size, permissions, date, etc.).

# **File Descriptors and Redirections**

A **file descriptor (FD)** in Unix/Linux is a reference managed by the kernel that represents an open file, socket, or any I/O resource. It acts as a **unique identifier** for an active I/O connection, allowing the operating system to handle **read/write operations** efficiently.

---

### **Analogy**
Think of a file descriptor as a **ticket number** at a coatroom:
- The ticket (**file descriptor**) represents your connection to your coat (**file/resource**).
- When you need your coat (**I/O operation**), you show the ticket to the attendant (**OS**) who knows where it is.
- Without the ticket, the OS wouldn't know which resource to interact with.

---

### **Default File Descriptors in Linux**
- **STDIN** (Standard Input) → **FD 0** → Input stream
- **STDOUT** (Standard Output) → **FD 1** → Output stream
- **STDERR** (Standard Error) → **FD 2** → Error output stream

---

### **STDIN and STDOUT Example**
Using the `cat` command:
```bash
cat
```

- **`STDIN (FD 0)`** : The user provides input (e.g., SOME INPUT).
- After pressing [ENTER], the input is echoed back to the terminal as:
- **`STDOUT (FD 1)`**: Displays the input text.

- Flow:
  - Keyboard → [STDIN] → cat → [STDOUT] → Terminal


---

## **STDOUT and STDERR**

When using commands like `find`, Linux differentiates between:
- **STDOUT (FD 1)** → Standard Output
- **STDERR (FD 2)** → Standard Error

For example, if a command returns a valid result and also "Permission denied" messages, the valid results go to **STDOUT**, and the errors go to **STDERR**.

---

### **Redirecting STDERR**
We can redirect **errors** (FD 2) to the null device (`/dev/null`) to hide them. The null device discards all data sent to it.

---

### **Redirecting STDOUT to a File**
We can redirect **standard output** to a file. This ensures only the valid results are written, excluding errors if they were previously redirected.

---

### **Redirecting STDOUT and STDERR to Separate Files**
To be precise, **STDOUT** and **STDERR** can be redirected to **different files**:
- FD 1 (**STDOUT**) → one file
- FD 2 (**STDERR**) → another file

---

### **Redirecting STDIN**
Using `<` redirects **standard input** (FD 0) from a file instead of typing it manually. This allows a command like `cat` to read data from a file as input.

---

### **Appending STDOUT to an Existing File**
- `>` creates a new file or overwrites an existing one without confirmation.
- `>>` **appends** the output to an existing file instead of overwriting it.

---

### **Redirecting STDIN Stream with EOF**
Using `<<` allows providing **input through a stream**. The End-Of-File (**EOF**) marker indicates the end of the input stream. This is often used with commands like `cat` to create files from inline input.

---

## **Pipes**

**Pipes (`|`)** are another way to redirect **STDOUT** by sending the output of one command directly into another command as **STDIN**. They are commonly used for **chaining commands** and **processing data efficiently**.

---

### **How Pipes Work**
- The **first command's STDOUT** becomes the **second command's STDIN**.
- Useful for applying filters or additional processing without creating intermediate files.

---

### **Common Usage Example**
- Using `grep` to filter results from `find`:
  - `find` lists files.
  - `grep` filters the output according to a defined pattern.
- Additional example: piping output through `wc` to count the lines of the filtered results.

---

### **Chaining Multiple Commands**
- Pipes can be chained multiple times:
  - Example: `command1 | command2 | command3`
- Each command processes the output of the previous one.

---

### **Why It Matters**
- Enables **structured commands** for extracting **only the needed information**.
- Reduces unnecessary steps and intermediate files.
- Provides **flexibility and precision** in managing I/O streams.

---

## **In Summary**

- **File Descriptors (FD):**  
  Numeric identifiers for I/O streams managed by the OS.  

- **Default FDs:**  
  | FD | Stream  | Purpose                |
  |----|---------|------------------------|
  | 0  | STDIN   | Input (keyboard, files) |
  | 1  | STDOUT  | Normal output (screen) |
  | 2  | STDERR  | Error messages         |

- **Redirections:**  
  - `>` : Redirect STDOUT to file (overwrite)  
  - `>>`: Append STDOUT to file  
  - `<` : Redirect file content to STDIN  
  - `2>`: Redirect STDERR  

- **Pipes (`|`):**  
  Chain commands by sending one command's STDOUT as another's STDIN.  

- **Key Idea:**  
  Control **where input comes from and where output goes** → enables **automation, precision, and efficient workflows** in Linux.
  By combining **file descriptors**, **redirections**, and **pipes**, we gain control over:
  - How input and output flows between **files**, **commands**, and **processes**.
  - Increased **efficiency** and **productivity** when working in Linux environments.

# **Filter Contents**

When working in Linux, it's often useful to **read files directly from the command line** without opening a text editor. This approach is essential for **quick analysis of large files**, such as logs or system configuration files.

---

## **Pagers: `more` and `less`**
- **Purpose:**  
  Both tools allow viewing file contents **one screen at a time** without modifying the file.
- **Key Features:**
  - Scroll through large files interactively.
  - Navigate forward and backward.
  - Search for text within the file.
- **Difference:**
  - `less` is generally more feature-rich and efficient than `more`.

### **Why Use Pagers?**
- Efficient for **large files** that do not fit on one screen.
- Ideal for **log analysis** or reviewing long text data.
- Does not require loading the entire file into memory at once.
  
### **Before Filtering**
- Pagers prepare us for **handling redirected output** from commands.
- They act as foundational tools before moving on to advanced filtering and text-processing utilities like `grep`, `sort`, and `awk`.

### **Example Scenario**
- Viewing `/etc/passwd`:
  - This file stores user account details (username, user ID, group ID, home directory, default shell).
- Instead of opening it in a text editor, a pager lets us inspect it **quickly and interactively**.

### **Key Takeaway**
Pagers like `more` and `less` are essential for **navigating and analyzing file content** efficiently in Linux. They provide the groundwork for filtering and processing data directly from the command line.

## **Filtering and Viewing File Contents**

When working with Linux systems, we often need to **inspect, navigate, and filter large files or command outputs**. Several tools make this efficient and flexible, allowing us to avoid opening text editors and enabling automation in scripts.
