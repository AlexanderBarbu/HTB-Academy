## 🧠 Linux Philosophy

Linux follows a minimalist, modular approach with 5 core principles:

| Principle                                 | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Everything is a file**                 | Most configuration is stored in text files.                                |
| **Small, single-purpose programs**       | Each tool does one thing well and can be reused.                           |
| **Chainability of programs**             | Tools can be combined to handle complex tasks.                             |
| **Avoid captive UIs**                    | Prefer command-line interface (shell) for full control.                    |
| **Config as text files**                 | e.g., /etc/passwd stores user data in plain text format.                |

---

## 🧩 Linux Components

| Component         | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bootloader**     | Starts the OS boot process (e.g. GRUB in Parrot OS).                        |
| **OS Kernel**      | Core part of Linux, managing I/O and hardware at low level.                 |
| **Daemons**        | Background services (e.g. scheduling, printing) that run after boot/login.  |
| **OS Shell**       | CLI interface for interacting with the OS (e.g. Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.).     |
| **Graphics Server**| Provides GUI capabilities via X-server.                                    |
| **Window Manager** | GUI desktop environments (e.g. GNOME, KDE, MATE, Cinnamon, etc.).           |
| **Utilities**      | Apps or scripts that perform specific tasks (for user or other programs).   |

---

## 🏗️ Linux Architecture (Layered View)

| Layer             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hardware**       | Physical components (CPU, RAM, disk, etc.).                                 |
| **Kernel**         | Manages hardware access, virtualizes resources, isolates processes.         |
| **Shell**          | Command-line interface to interact with the kernel.                         |
| **System Utilities**| Provide functionality and user-accessible tools of the OS.                 |

# 📂 Linux File System Hierarchy

Linux uses a **tree-like hierarchical structure**, standardized by the **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**. Everything starts from the root directory `/`, and all other directories are mounted underneath it.

---

## 🗂️ Top-Level Directories

| Path       | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `/`        | The **root directory**. Contains the essential files needed to boot the OS before other filesystems are mounted. All other filesystems are mounted here as subdirectories. |
| `/bin`     | Contains **essential user command binaries** (e.g. `ls`, `cp`, `mv`). |
| `/boot`    | Contains the **bootloader**, **kernel image**, and other files required to boot Linux. |
| `/dev`     | Contains **device files** that represent hardware components. |
| `/etc`     | Contains **system-wide configuration files** for the OS and installed applications. |
| `/home`    | Contains **user home directories** (e.g. `/home/alex`). |
| `/lib`     | Contains **shared libraries** needed by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`. |
| `/media`   | Mount point for **removable media** (USB, CD-ROMs, etc.). |
| `/mnt`     | Temporary mount point for manually mounted filesystems. |
| `/opt`     | Optional software and **third-party applications** are installed here. |
| `/root`    | The **home directory of the root user**. |
| `/sbin`    | Contains **system administration binaries**, used by root. |
| `/tmp`     | Temporary files used by the OS and applications; usually cleared on reboot. |
| `/usr`     | Secondary hierarchy for **user utilities**, applications, libraries, and documentation. |
| `/var`     | Contains **variable data** such as logs, spool files, mail, and cache. |

# 🐧 Linux Distributions

## 📌 What is a Linux Distribution?

A **Linux distribution (or distro)** is an operating system built on top of the **Linux kernel**, bundled with a set of software packages, tools, and configurations for different use cases.

You can think of distros as **different branches of the same company**:
- Same **core employees** → the kernel and system components
- Same **company culture** → Linux philosophy (modularity, openness)
- But different **products & services** → packages, configs, UI

---

## 🖥️ Why So Many Distros?

Each distro is tailored for different needs:
- **Desktops**: User-friendly interfaces, multimedia, customization
- **Servers**: Stability, security, long-term support

# 💻 Introduction to Shell

## 🧠 Why Learn the Shell?

- The shell is essential to interacting with Linux systems, especially **servers**.
- Many **web servers** and **infrastructure machines** run Linux due to its **stability and low error rate**.
- Mastering the shell means gaining full control over the system — far beyond what a GUI offers.

---

## 🖥️ What Is a Shell?

- A **shell** (also called terminal or command line) is a **text-based interface** between the user and the **Linux kernel**.
- It allows you to:
  - Navigate directories
  - Manage files
  - Monitor and control system processes
  - Run automation scripts

### 🧪 Visual Analogy:
> Think of the **shell** as the **server room** of a building, and the **terminal** as the **reception desk** where you deliver instructions.

---

## 🖼️ Terminal Emulators

**Terminal emulators** are software programs that:
- Emulate a physical terminal within a GUI
- Provide access to the shell in a graphical environment

### 🧩 Multiplexers (e.g., `tmux`):
- Allow multiple terminals in one window
- Useful for:
  - Splitting screens
  - Working in multiple directories
  - Creating isolated workspaces

🧪 *Example:*  
A `tmux` setup might show three panes:
- One with `BloodHound` files  
- One with `Impacket`  
- One with `SecLists`  
All controlled from the same terminal window.

---

## 🐚 Types of Shells

The **most common shell** in Linux is:

- **BASH (Bourne Again Shell)** – part of the GNU project  
  - Supports scripting
  - Automates workflows
  - Offers powerful built-in tools for file/system interaction

### 🔄 Other popular shells:

| Shell | Description |
|-------|-------------|

# 💬 Bash Prompt (PS1) Description

## 🧠 What is the Bash Prompt?

- The **Bash prompt** is the line that appears in the terminal to indicate that the system is ready for input.
- By default, it shows:
  - `username` – who you are
  - `hostname` – the computer name
  - `current working directory`
- The prompt usually ends in:
  - `$` for regular users
  - `#` for root (privileged user)


---

## 📍 Prompt Format Examples

user@hostname:~$        'regular user in home directory'
root@htb:/htb#          ' root user in /htb directory '
$                       ' prompt with missing info (PS1 not set)'
'#'                       ' same, but with root privileges '
