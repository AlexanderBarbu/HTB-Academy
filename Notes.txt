WEB REQUESTS MODULE - Still need notes

Conclusion
This module covered the essentials of HTTP requests and how we can send HTTP requests with different HTTP methods. Such concepts are necessary for beginning to work with web applications. A successful security professional must understand and be able to explain the core concepts of the technologies that they are charged with attacking, defending, and securing.

As you work on testing web applications, you may primarily be working with proxying tools like Burp Suite or ZAP, so we advise working through the Using Web Proxies module next. However, understanding HTTP requests and their different methods is essential for starting to use such proxying tools. Also, on many occasions, being able to perform quick tests using browser dev tools or cURL would be much faster than switching to a different tool. Furthermore, cURL knowledge is essential for scripting web requests and automating different tests, which may become very handy for exploit development in the future.
