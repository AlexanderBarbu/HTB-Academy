# Way of Thinking 

- Can't learn everything → focus on **principles** & **adaptability**.  
- Deep dive in 1 thing → easier to learn others.  
- Communities: respect + learn together.  
- Practice > Theory (active > passive learning).  
- Good pentester = knows how to **find, choose, adapt** info.  
- Missing key: **LEARN how to learn**.  
## R. D. Tennent's principles
- The principle of abstraction
- The principle of Correspondence
- The principle of  Data Type Completeness

# Occam's Razor

`The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.`

- Principle: **Simplest explanation is most probable**.  
- Don’t overcomplicate → check basics first (e.g., power outlet before PSU).  
- Focus on **concepts**, not just steps:
  - SQLi = concept of injecting queries, not just payloads.  
  - Pentesting = adapt to each unique system, work with available info.  
- Big picture understanding → easier to adapt steps in new contexts.  
- Core lesson: **Think outside the box, but keep it simple**.

# Learning Efficiency 

- **Main challenge**: huge info volume → need to combine knowledge, adaptation & new info.  
- Key questions:
  - What do I know?
  - What do I not know?
- **Failure = essential** → builds experience & repertoire.  
- HTB Academy: learn by doing, guided → practice first, theory sticks better.  
- To be “good” = know what you’re doing → comes from **experience + associations**.  

## Learning Rules
- **10,000-Hour Rule** → mastery needs years.  
- **Josh Kaufman** → 20 hrs (≈45min/day) → competence.  
- **Pareto (80/20)** → 20% effort → 80% results.  
- **Learning Pyramid** → mix of active + passive learning → faster growth.

# Learning Types

## Passive Learning
- Reading only → ~10% retention.  
- Watching demos → ~30%.  

## Active Learning
- Discussing with others → ~50%.  
- Practicing hands-on → ~75%.  
- Key: **Practice + discussion = mastery**.  

## Information Quality
- Not all info is useful → must build **repertoire** through practice.  
- Context matters → efficiency = quality + usage of info.  

## Motivation & Focus
- Motivation comes from:
  - Recognizing even small successes.  
  - Staying focused on goals.  
  - Looking back at progress → fuels momentum.  
- Take breaks → avoid overload (“vortex effect” analogy).  

## Getting Stuck
- Causes: fatigue, tunnel vision, info overload.  
- Solution: creativity, shift perspective, notice small details.  
- Associations (colours, memories, context) help recall later.

# The Brain

## Brain Development
- Different regions → different strengths (e.g., tech skills vs social skills).  
- Learning changes brain physiologically.  

## Thought (Theory)
- Thought = process (action/reaction) to influences (internal/external), interpreted + linked via personal methodology.  
- Creates **associations** (nodes: info linked in memory).  
- Brain always active (awake & asleep).  

## Conscious vs Subconscious
- **Conscious**: awareness of external/internal world, active observation & decision.  
- **Subconscious**: more active, processes most thoughts.  
  - Emotions = reflection of subconscious.  
  - Decisions often made before conscious awareness (~30s before).  
- **Libet Experiments**:  
  - Stimuli <0.5s → not consciously perceived but subconscious guesses correct.  
  - Conscious awareness requires ~500ms stimulus.

# The Goal

## Definition
- Goal = desired future state (clear, measurable endpoint).  
- Many types: quantitative, qualitative, complementary, competing, main, secondary, etc.  

## Key Insights
- 200+ studies (40k participants) → **challenging + specific goals** = 90% more success.  
- Clear goals are essential → they define the path we take.  

## Impact on Learning
- Different goals → different approaches (exam vs certification vs mastery).  
- Shortcutting (asking for answers instead of solving) = fewer brain associations → less real learning.  
- **Goals shape how we think and learn.**  

## Path to Goals
- No one knows the exact path beforehand → only the **goal** is clear.  
- Many valid ways exist → one person’s way ≠ the only way.  
- Decision = commit to a goal → then adapt the path.
