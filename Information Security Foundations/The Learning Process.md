# Way of Thinking 

- Can't learn everything → focus on **principles** & **adaptability**.  
- Deep dive in 1 thing → easier to learn others.  
- Communities: respect + learn together.  
- Practice > Theory (active > passive learning).  
- Good pentester = knows how to **find, choose, adapt** info.  
- Missing key: **LEARN how to learn**.  
## R. D. Tennent's principles
- The principle of abstraction
- The principle of Correspondence
- The principle of  Data Type Completeness

# Occam's Razor

`The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.`

- Principle: **Simplest explanation is most probable**.  
- Don’t overcomplicate → check basics first (e.g., power outlet before PSU).  
- Focus on **concepts**, not just steps:
  - SQLi = concept of injecting queries, not just payloads.  
  - Pentesting = adapt to each unique system, work with available info.  
- Big picture understanding → easier to adapt steps in new contexts.  
- Core lesson: **Think outside the box, but keep it simple**.  
---
# Learning Efficiency 

- **Main challenge**: huge info volume → need to combine knowledge, adaptation & new info.  
- Key questions:
  - What do I know?
  - What do I not know?
- **Failure = essential** → builds experience & repertoire.  
- HTB Academy: learn by doing, guided → practice first, theory sticks better.  
- To be “good” = know what you’re doing → comes from **experience + associations**.  

## Learning Rules
- **10,000-Hour Rule** → mastery needs years.  
- **Josh Kaufman** → 20 hrs (≈45min/day) → competence.  
- **Pareto (80/20)** → 20% effort → 80% results.  
- **Learning Pyramid** → mix of active + passive learning → faster growth.

# Learning Types

## Passive Learning
- Reading only → ~10% retention.  
- Watching demos → ~30%.  

## Active Learning
- Discussing with others → ~50%.  
- Practicing hands-on → ~75%.  
- Key: **Practice + discussion = mastery**.  

## Information Quality
- Not all info is useful → must build **repertoire** through practice.  
- Context matters → efficiency = quality + usage of info.  

## Motivation & Focus
- Motivation comes from:
  - Recognizing even small successes.  
  - Staying focused on goals.  
  - Looking back at progress → fuels momentum.  
- Take breaks → avoid overload (“vortex effect” analogy).  

## Getting Stuck
- Causes: fatigue, tunnel vision, info overload.  
- Solution: creativity, shift perspective, notice small details.  
- Associations (colours, memories, context) help recall later.

# The Brain

## Brain Development
- Different regions → different strengths (e.g., tech skills vs social skills).  
- Learning changes brain physiologically.  

## Thought (Theory)
- Thought = process (action/reaction) to influences (internal/external), interpreted + linked via personal methodology.  
- Creates **associations** (nodes: info linked in memory).  
- Brain always active (awake & asleep).  

## Conscious vs Subconscious
- **Conscious**: awareness of external/internal world, active observation & decision.  
- **Subconscious**: more active, processes most thoughts.  
  - Emotions = reflection of subconscious.  
  - Decisions often made before conscious awareness (~30s before).  
- **Libet Experiments**:  
  - Stimuli <0.5s → not consciously perceived but subconscious guesses correct.  
  - Conscious awareness requires ~500ms stimulus.

# The Goal

## Definition
- Goal = desired future state (clear, measurable endpoint).  
- Many types: quantitative, qualitative, complementary, competing, main, secondary, etc.  

## Key Insights
- 200+ studies (40k participants) → **challenging + specific goals** = 90% more success.  
- Clear goals are essential → they define the path we take.  

## Impact on Learning
- Different goals → different approaches (exam vs certification vs mastery).  
- Shortcutting (asking for answers instead of solving) = fewer brain associations → less real learning.  
- **Goals shape how we think and learn.**  

## Path to Goals
- No one knows the exact path beforehand → only the **goal** is clear.  
- Many valid ways exist → one person’s way ≠ the only way.  
- Decision = commit to a goal → then adapt the path.  
---
# Decision Making

## Basics
- Decision = choosing one of several options.  
- Driven by both rational & emotional factors.  
- People don’t act only on cost-benefit → limited rationality.  

## Trolley Problem
- Classic thought experiment: sacrifice 1 to save 5?  
- Shows decisions are complex, extreme, and often missing factors.  
- Key lesson: we often **self-impose limits** (e.g., “only switch allowed”), but in reality, more options may exist.  

## Core Insights
- Decisions depend on **factors**: distance, speed, tools, time, etc.  
- More facts = better, more precise decisions.  
- Don’t accept “impossible” → usually means insufficient data.  
- Failure often comes from giving up before trying.  

## Final Formula
- Success =  
  **Decision (Decision Making)**  
  + **Defined Goal (The Goal)**  
  + **True Willingness (Heart)**  
  + **Brain (Conscious & Subconscious working together)**

# Documentation

## Purpose
- Present info clearly & reproducibly.  
- Style depends on **audience** (internal notes vs client report).  

## Key Characteristics
- **Overview**  
- **Structure**  
- **Clarity**  

## Tools
- **CherryTree** → structured notes (HTB Recommendation)
- **FlameShot** → annotated screenshots.  

## Guidelines
- Write from the reader’s perspective.  
- Avoid repetition & ambiguity.  
- Keep it simple, easy to follow.  
- For clients → clarify what matters most to them.  
---
# Organization

## Concept
- Overview = “map” → keeps us oriented toward the goal.  
- Without orientation → risk of getting lost and wasting time.  
- In pentesting → crucial for report writing & handling large info quickly.  

## Example
- Inexperienced woodcutter: 30m sharpening, 3h cutting.  
- Experienced woodcutter: 3h sharpening, 30m cutting.  
→ Preparation & organization save time.  

## Suggested Methods
- **Scrum**  
- **Agile**  
- **To-Do Lists**  
- **Bullet Journal**

# Questioning

## Core Idea
- Skill = asking the **right questions**, not just finding answers.  
- Questions = orientation → help define next steps & direction.  
- In pentesting: **hardest part is asking the right question**.  

## Question States
- No “good” or “bad” questions → irrelevant labels.  
- Only **rough** vs **precise** questions.  
  - Rough: “How can I hack X?”  
  - Precise: “How can I use SMB service to enumerate user accounts?”  

## Role of Questions
- We ask 3–5 questions per minute (consciously or not).  
- Questions = links between knowledge nodes in brain → essential to learning.  
- Removing questions = reducing learning.  

## Everyday Examples
- Recipe = Ingredients (content) + Method (questions = steps).  
- Lock example:
  - Standard lock → no question (key known).  
  - Vault → need right questions to find tools/methods.  

## Purpose of Questions
- Official def. “sentence to elicit info” is flawed.  
- Shortest real questions: *Why? How? Where?* → still valid.  
- Asking doesn’t always yield info directly, but frames exploration.  

## Dimensions of Questions
- Based on:
  - **Origin** (where it comes from)  
  - **Process** (how it’s asked)  
  - **Result/Goal** (what we seek)  
- Time-based goals:  
  - Past (understand reason)  
  - Present (understand process)  
  - Future (predict effect)  

>[!NOTE]
>Right **goal → right question → better answers**.  
> Quality of questioning defines learning & problem-solving effectiveness.

# Relationship-Oriented-Questioning Model (ROQ)

## Core Idea
- All questions = **relationships** between components.  
- Components:
  - **Your Position** → your view/context.  
  - **The Object** → core element of the question.  
  - **Known** → info you already have.  
  - **Unknown** → info missing.  
  - **Other Positions** → views of others.  

## Rules
- Object = always defined.  
- At least **2 components** required.  
- Your Position = always present.  

## Example
Question: *“What methods exist to remotely access Windows OS?”*  
- Object → Windows.  
- Known → some methods (e.g., RDP, WinRM).  
- Unknown → other methods.  
- Connections:
  - Windows ↔ Methods = “Listening Service” & “Remote Access”.  
  - Methods ↔ You = “Allow to interact with / Using”.  
  - Windows ↔ You = “Operating on / Provides functionality”.  

## Benefits
- Shows clearly what is missing (Unknown).  
- Once Unknown → Known, model updates (stackable).  
- Forces precision: vague questions won’t fit the model.  
- With practice (5–10 times), becomes **automatic thinking tool**.  

## Final Definition
- A **right question** = precise, establishes relationships, moves you closer to an answer.  

---

# Mini Framework: Asking Better Questions
1. **Define the Object** → what is this about?  
2. **Set Your Position** → why do you care?  
3. **Map Known vs Unknown** → what do you know, what’s missing?  
4. **Consider Other Positions** → how might others see this?  
5. **Check Precision** → rephrase until the question is clear and actionable.

# Handling Frustration

## What is Frustration
- Emotional reaction = disappointment or powerlessness.  
- Two types:
  - **External** → outside influences (criticism, opinions).  
  - **Internal** → subconscious thought processes.  
- Feelings reflect subconscious thoughts → analyze from 3rd-person view for objectivity.  

## Frustration Tolerance
- People with low tolerance → give up quickly, stress, avoidance, aggression.  
- Tolerance can be trained.  
- Calm people in stress = high frustration tolerance.  

## Causes in Pentesting
- Often from missing **resources/info** (→ “Enumeration is key”).  
- Lack of skill = anxiety → stuck in comfort zone.  
- Must train info-gathering skills continuously.  

## Training Tolerance
- Consciously place yourself in controlled frustrating situations.  
- Example:
  - Forced to run 2 miles for train = high frustration.  
  - Choosing to leave late & run = lower frustration → self-analysis instead of blame.  

>[!NOTE]
> Frustration = **temporary**, passes with time.  
> Don’t fear it → embrace controlled frustration for growth.  
> Over time → calmer reactions, stronger self-confidence.  
> Can control **inner frustration**, rarely external.

# Learning Progress

## Core Idea
- Progress = compare past vs present knowledge within a timeframe.  
- Only **you** can confirm your progress → others can’t judge without walking the same path.  

## Mountain Analogy
- Learning = climbing uphill → always exhausting.  
- Stopping = staying in place.  
- Even small improvements compound:  
  - (1.00)^365 = 1  
  - (1.01)^365 = 37.7 → +1% daily = huge growth.  

## Tracking Progress
- **List 1 (Baseline)**:  
  - Date + all current knowledge/skills (scale 1–10).  
  - Detailed snapshot saved for long-term comparison.  
- **List 2 (Ongoing)**:  
  - Continuously add new skills/topics learned.  
  - Even 10 minutes/day counts.  
  - Optionally log by calendar week.  

>[!NOTE]
> Small, consistent steps → exponential results.  
> Progress is personal → only visible when tracked over time.
